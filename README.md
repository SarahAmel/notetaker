In the terminal the user can do node server.js and go to localhost:3001


Once at localhost:3001 the user can click the get started button and give the note a title and under the title begin creating a note where it says Tell me something that's on your mind


When the user is finished with the note the user can save the note by clicking the save icon located on the right hand side next to the + symbol which allows the user to create addition notes.. 
However be sure to save the note first so you can acess it on the left handside otherwise when clicking the + symbol it will simply create a new note and delete the other one!

The play back zoom videos helped immensely as well as the mini project from mod 11 from the ucf bootcamp.

The staff within the UCF bootcamp helped me tremendously.

I am greatly appreciative of all the knowlegeable Tutors available and TA's who helped after or before class.
